### [Scribe: Open-source Language Solutions](https://github.com/scribe-org)

Scribe's current project is [Scribe-iOS](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-iOS), a pack of iOS and iPadOS keyboards for language learners. Features include translation, verb conjugation and word annotation that give users the tools needed to communicate with confidence. Focus will later shift to [Scribe-Android](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Android) and [Scribe-Desktop](https://github.com/scribe-org/Scribe-Desktop).
